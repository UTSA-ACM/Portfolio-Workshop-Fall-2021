# Getting Started with Web Development
## What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. We use HTML to write the structure of the website.
Making a website is kind of like ... making a cake! üéÇ  HTML is basically a recipe and the `elements` are like the ingredients.

## What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. We use it to describe how the HTML should be displayed. If HTML is the cake, then CSS is all the icing and decorations that make it look nice!

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript adds functionality to your website and allows people to interact with it.
So if we've baked and decorated our cake, JavaScript basically tells people how to eat it! üçΩÔ∏è

# Hello World
Now that you know a bit about bakin' cakes (and writing web development code), it's time to run Hello World!
[Head here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/online_html_editor.php) and click the `‚öôÔ∏è Preview` button in the top left-hand corner. You should be able to preview your `"Hello World"` website in the pane to the right. This example has HTML and CSS.

Now that you know what some simple website code looks like, here's some more information about what all that code is and what it does:
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_syntax.asp)
* [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)

Follow along with the tutorials and the exercises to familiarize yourself with what HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code look like and how they work!

Feel free check out [CodePen](https://codepen.io/pen/) to practice writing and combining what you learned from the W3Schools tutorials üôÇ
***Hint**: If you make a free account, it'll give you a nifty tutorial and you'll be able to see a preview of whatever you're coding!*
